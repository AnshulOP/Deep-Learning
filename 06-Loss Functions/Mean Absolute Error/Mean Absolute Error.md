                                                        Mean Absolute Error
The mean absolute error (MAE) is a loss function used in regression analysis to evaluate how well a machine learning model fits the data. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values. In simple terms, it calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

The formula for calculating the MAE is:

    MAE = 1/n * ∑i=1ton|yi - ŷi|
    where n is the number of observations, yi is the actual value, and ŷi is the predicted value.

Advantages of using MAE as a loss function:
1. Easy to understand: MAE is a simple and easy-to-understand loss function. It calculates the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
2. Robust to outliers: MAE is less sensitive to outliers than mean squared error (MSE). This is because it does not square the errors and gives equal weightage to all the errors.
3. Interpretable: MAE is interpretable, which means that the values it produces are in the same units as the target variable. This makes it easier to interpret the results.

Disadvantages of using MAE as a loss function:
1. Less sensitive to changes: MAE is less sensitive to small changes in the predicted values than MSE. This means that if there is a small change in the predicted value, it may not be reflected in the loss function.
2. May not work well for complex models: MAE may not work well for complex models, as it does not penalize large errors as heavily as MSE. For complex models, MSE may be a better choice.

In summary, the MAE loss function is a simple and easy-to-understand way to evaluate the performance of a regression model. It is less sensitive to outliers and produces interpretable results. However, it may not be as effective for complex models and may not be as sensitive to small changes in the predicted values as MSE.
