                                                            Loss Functions
A loss function is a measure of how well the neural network is performing on a specific task, such as classification or regression. The goal of the neural network is to minimize this loss function in order to improve its performance.

Loss functions calculate the difference between the predicted output of the neural network and the true output (or target). The difference is known as the "loss" or "cost". The neural network then adjusts its parameters (weights and biases) using an optimization algorithm (such as stochastic gradient descent) in order to minimize the loss function.

Different types of loss functions are used for different types of tasks. For example, the mean squared error (MSE) loss function is commonly used for regression tasks, while the categorical cross-entropy loss function is commonly used for classification tasks.

Choosing an appropriate loss function is important for training a neural network effectively. It is also important to note that different loss functions have different properties and trade-offs. For example, some loss functions may be more sensitive to outliers than others, while others may be more computationally efficient.

In summary, loss functions are a fundamental component of neural networks, used to measure how well the network is performing on a specific task. By minimizing the loss function, the neural network can improve its performance on the task.
