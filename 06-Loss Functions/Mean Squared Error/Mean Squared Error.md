                                                           Mean Squared Error
Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a loss function that is commonly used in regression analysis to measure the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of a dataset. In other words, it measures the average of the sum of squares of the differences between predicted and actual values.

The formula for MSE is:

    MSE = (1/n) * Σ (y - ŷ)²
    where y is the actual value, ŷ is the predicted value, n is the number of data points.

Advantages of MSE:
1. It is widely used in regression problems and is a very popular loss function.
2. It is sensitive to outliers and gives higher weightage to larger errors, which is helpful in cases where large errors need to be minimized.
3. Squaring the differences ensures that the negative errors don't cancel out the positive errors, providing an accurate representation of the overall error.

Disadvantages of MSE:
1. Squaring the errors can give more weightage to outliers and make the model less robust.
2. It does not provide any insight into the direction of the error, i.e., whether the error is positive or negative.
3. Since it penalizes larger errors more heavily, it may not be the best choice of loss function if the goal is to minimize the maximum error (i.e., the worst-case scenario).

In summary, MSE is a commonly used loss function in regression analysis that provides an accurate representation of the overall error. While it has several advantages, it may not be the best choice of loss function in all cases, and should be carefully considered in the context of the problem being solved.
