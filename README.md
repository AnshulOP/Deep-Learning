### What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to learn from data. It is used in a variety of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and self-driving cars.

### Datasets
1. MNIST
2. CIFAR-10
3. ImageNet
4. COCO

### Examples
This repository will include code examples for deep learning. Currently, we dont have all the following examples but with further updations it will be available:
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

### Getting Started
To get started with deep learning, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. We recommend using Python 3. You will also need to install the following packages:

1. TensorFlow
2. Keras
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Pandas

You can install these packages using pip, a package manager for Python:

    pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib pandas
    
### Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any ideas for new examples or datasets, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

We hope this repository will be helpful in your deep learning journey!
