                                                         Binary Cross Entropy
The binary cross entropy loss function is commonly used for binary classification problems, where the task is to predict one of two possible outcomes. It is a measure of the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels of a binary classification model.

The formula for binary cross entropy loss is:

    L(y, y_hat) = - [y*log(y_hat) + (1-y)*log(1-y_hat)]
    where,
    y is the true label (0 or 1)
    y_hat is the predicted probability of the positive class (between 0 and 1)
    
The loss function penalizes the model more heavily for larger differences between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. Specifically, if the true label is 1, the loss is proportional to the negative logarithm of the predicted probability of the positive class. If the true label is 0, the loss is proportional to the negative logarithm of the predicted probability of the negative class (1 minus the probability of the positive class).

Advantages:
1. Binary cross entropy loss is a widely used loss function for binary classification problems, and is implemented in many deep learning frameworks.
2. It is a continuous and differentiable function, which is important for gradient-based optimization algorithms.
3. It provides a clear measure of how well the model is performing, and can be used to compare the performance of different models.
4. It is robust to class imbalance, which can be a problem for other loss functions such as mean squared error.

Disadvantages:
1. The binary cross entropy loss function may be sensitive to outliers or mislabeled examples, which can lead to suboptimal models.
2. It assumes that the model's errors are independent and identically distributed, which may not always be the case in practice.
3. The loss function does not provide any insight into the direction or nature of the errors made by the model, and may not be suitable for certain applications where interpretability is important.
