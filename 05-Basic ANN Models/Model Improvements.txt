Model Improvements

Here are a few suggestions for possible improvements to your model:

1. Add more layers: You could experiment with adding more layers to your model, which can allow it to learn more complex representations of the input data. For example, you could add additional dense layers with varying numbers of neurons or activation functions.

2. Adjust the number of neurons: The number of neurons in each layer can have a significant impact on the performance of your model. You could experiment with different numbers of neurons in each layer to see if this improves performance.

3. Try different activation functions: The activation functions used in each layer can also have a significant impact on the performance of your model. You could experiment with different activation functions, such as sigmoid or tanh, to see if they lead to better performance.

4. Use regularization techniques: Regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of your model.

5. Adjust the learning rate and optimizer: The learning rate and optimizer used during training can also have an impact on the performance of your model. You could experiment with different learning rates and optimizers to see if this improves performance.
