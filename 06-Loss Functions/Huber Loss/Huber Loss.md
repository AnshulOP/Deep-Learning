                                                              Huber Loss
Huber loss is a loss function used in machine learning and optimization problems, particularly in regression analysis. It is similar to mean squared error but is less sensitive to outliers in the data. Huber loss combines the best properties of mean squared error and mean absolute error, making it a popular choice in robust regression.

The Huber loss function is defined as:

    L(y, f(x)) = {0.5 * (y - f(x))^2 if |y - f(x)| <= delta,
    delta * |y - f(x)| - 0.5 * delta^2 otherwise}
    where y is the true value, f(x) is the predicted value, and delta is a hyperparameter that determines the threshold at which the loss function switches from              
    quadratic to linear.

Advantages of Huber loss:
1. Robustness: Huber loss is less sensitive to outliers than mean squared error, making it useful for datasets with extreme values or noisy data.
2. Differentiability: Huber loss is differentiable, which makes it useful for gradient-based optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent.
3. Flexibility: The delta parameter in Huber loss can be adjusted to control the balance between the quadratic and linear regions of the loss function, allowing for greater flexibility in modeling.

Disadvantages of Huber loss:
1. Complexity: Huber loss is more complex than mean squared error or mean absolute error, which can make it more difficult to implement or understand.
2. Hyperparameter tuning: The delta parameter in Huber loss needs to be tuned for each problem, which can be time-consuming and require domain expertise.
3. Sensitivity to parameter values: The performance of Huber loss can be sensitive to the choice of delta, which can make it challenging to find the optimal value.
