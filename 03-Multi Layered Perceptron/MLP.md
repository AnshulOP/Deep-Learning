                                                       Multi Layered Perceptron
A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of nodes or neurons. It is a feedforward network, which means that information flows in only one direction, from the input layer to the output layer.

The input layer receives input signals, which are then propagated forward through one or more hidden layers, and ultimately produce output signals at the output layer. The hidden layers contain nonlinear activation functions, which allow the network to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

MLPs are trained using a process called backpropagation, which involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network in order to minimize the difference between the actual output and the desired output. This process is typically done using a variant of gradient descent, which iteratively adjusts the weights and biases to find a minimum of the loss function.

Some important characteristics of MLPs include:

1. Nonlinear activation functions: The most common activation functions used in MLPs are the sigmoid function and the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function. These functions allow the network to model nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs.
2. Weight initialization: The weights of the network are typically initialized randomly to avoid getting stuck in local optima during training.
3. Regularization: Techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization can be used to prevent overfitting of the network to the training data.
4. Hyperparameters: MLPs have a number of hyperparameters that need to be chosen, such as the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes per layer, the learning rate, and the batch size.
5. MLPs are commonly used for a wide variety of tasks, including classification, regression, and pattern recognition. They have been used in fields such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. Despite their popularity, MLPs can be computationally expensive to train, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex architectures.
